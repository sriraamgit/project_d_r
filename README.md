# project_disaster_response

Summary of the Project:
          The overall summary in one line of this project is that, we analyze disaster data to build a model for an API that 
       classifies disaster messages and also display some visualizations as the picture gives a better idea. 
          The dataset consists of real messages that were sent during disaster events.I created a machine learning pipeline
       and wrote clean organised code to categorize these events so that the messages can be sent to any disaster relief 
       agency.
          An emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in the 36 categories described in this
       project.
